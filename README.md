Hierarchy 2 free is now deprecated (This repo and also on asset store), i no longer update or add features to it.

Instead i create a paid "Hierarchy ...." package (Currently waiting Asset Store review and approval), an upcoming paid package allows me to spend more time on it, add new features, fix bugs, optimize, update soon when something changes, and make sure it work stably with Unity.

Upcoming paid package guarantee support 2022.2.x and higher (Official support LTS, Normal version. Beta and Alpha if possible).
Also works with some LTS before 2022.2.x like Hierarchy 2 (But not guaranteed).

New Hierarchy Package Asset Store(Update soon)

[Hierarchy 2 Asset Store](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/utilities/hierarchy-2-166483) (Deprecated)

Don't hesitate to email me if you have any questions.
